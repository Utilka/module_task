                <h2 id="Pony">Pony</h2>
                <p class="note">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
                <p class="about-us__main-text">A pony is a small horse (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. There are many different
                    breeds. Compared to other horses, ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails and overall coat, as well as proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, thicker necks, and shorter heads with broader foreheads. The word pony
                    derives from the old French poulenet, meaning foal, a young, immature horse, but this is not the modern meaning; unlike a horse foal, a pony remains small when fully grown. On occasion, people who are unfamiliar with horses may confuse
                    an adult pony with a foal. The ancestors of most modern ponies developed small stature because they lived on marginally livable horse habitat. These smaller animals were domesticated and bred for various purposes all over the Northern
                    Hemisphere. Ponies were historically used for driving and freight transport, as children's mounts, for recreational riding, and later as competitors and performers in their own right. During the Industrial Revolution, particularly
                    in Great Britain, a significant number were used as pit ponies, hauling loads of coal in the mines. Ponies are generally considered intelligent and friendly. They are sometimes also described as stubborn or cunning. Properly trained
                    ponies are appropriate mounts for children who are learning to ride. Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size. In modern use, many organizations define a pony as a mature horse that measures
                    less than 14.3 hands (59 inches, 150 cm) at the withers, but there are a number of exceptions. Different organizations that use a strict measurement model vary from 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm) to nearly 14.3 hands (59 inches, 150
                    cm). Many breeds classify an animal as either horse or pony based on pedigree and phenotype, no matter its height. Some full-sized horses may be called ponies for a term of endearment. </p>
                <h2 id="Horses-and-ponies">Horses and ponies</h2>
                <p class="about-us__main-text">For many forms of competition, the official definition of a pony is a horse that measures less than 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) at the withers. Standard horses are 14.2 or taller. The International Federation for Equestrian Sports defines
                    the official cutoff point at 148 centimetres (58.27 in) (just over 14.2 h) without shoes and 149 centimetres (58.66 in) (just over 14.2–1/2 h) with shoes, though allows a margin for competition measurement of up to 150 centimetres
                    (59.1 in) (14.3 h) without shoes, or 151 centimetres (59.45 in) (just under 14.3–1/2 h) with shoes.[1] However, the term "pony" can be used in general (or affectionately) for any small horse, regardless of its actual size or breed.
                    Furthermore, some horse breeds may have individuals who mature under that height but are still called "horses" and are allowed to compete as horses. In Australia, horses that measure from 14 hands to 15 hands are known as a "galloway",
                    and ponies in Australia measure under 14 hands.[2] People who are unfamiliar with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that will grow up to be horse-sized may be no taller than some ponies in their
                    first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they grow up to be horse or pony-sized, can be
                    distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the
                    mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.

                <h2 id="History">History</h2>
                <p class="about-us__main-text">Ponies originally developed as a landrace adapted to a harsh natural environment, and were considered part of the "draft" subtype typical of Northern Europe. At one time, it was hypothesized that they may have descended from a wild "draft"
                    subspecies of Equus ferus.[3] Studies of mitochondrial DNA (which is passed on though the female line) indicate that a large number of wild mares have contributed to modern domestic breeds;[4][5] in contrast, studies of y-DNA (passed
                    down the male line) suggest that there was possibly just one single male ancestor of all domesticated breeds.[6] Domestication of the horse probably first occurred in the Eurasian steppes with horses of between 13 hands (52 inches,
                    132 cm) to over 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm),[7] and as horse domestication spread, the male descendants of the original stallion went on to be bred with local wild mares.[6][7] Domesticated ponies of all breeds originally developed
                    mainly from the need for a working animal that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. The usefulness of the pony was noted by farmers who observed that a pony could outperform
                    a draft horse on small farms.[8] By the 20th century, many pony breeds had Arabian and other blood added to make a more refined pony suitable for riding.[9] </p>
                <h2 id="Uses">Uses</h2>
                <p class="about-us__main-text">Ponies are seen in many different equestrian pursuits. Some breeds, such as the Hackney pony, are primarily used for driving, while other breeds, such as the Connemara pony and Australian Pony, are used primarily for riding. Others, such
                    as the Welsh pony, are used for both riding and driving. A Shetland pony shown in harness There is no direct correlation between a horse's size and its inherent athletic ability.[10] Ponies compete at events that include show hunter,
                    English riding on the flat, driving, and western riding classes at horse shows, as well as other competitive events such as gymkhana and combined driving. They are seen in casual pursuits such as trail riding, but a few ponies have
                    performed in international-level competition. Though many exhibitors confine themselves to classes just for ponies, some top ponies are competitive against full-sized horses. For example, a 14.1 hand pony named Stroller was a member
                    of the British Equestrian show jumping team, and won the silver medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics. More recently, the 14.1-3/4 hand pony Theodore O'Connor won the gold medal in eventing at the 2007 Pan American Games. Pony Clubs, open
                    to young people who own either horses or ponies, are formed worldwide to educate young people about horses, promote responsible horse ownership, and also sponsor competitive events for young people and smaller horses. In many parts
                    of the world ponies are also still used as working animals, as pack animals and for pulling various horse-drawn vehicles. They are used for children's pony rides at traveling carnivals and at children's private parties where small
                    children can take short rides on ponies that are saddled and then either led individually or hitched to a "pony wheel" (a non-motorized device akin to a hot walker) that leads six to eight ponies at a time. Ponies are sometimes seen
                    at summer camps for children, and are widely used for pony trekking and other forms of Equitourism riding holidays, often carrying adults as well as children. Ponies are used for riding Kedarnath pilgrims in India. </p>
